  <p>My name is Dmitry Voronov. I was born in the south of Russia in Krasnodar Region. Some of you may heard of my region after Winter Olymic games of 2012 in Sochi, as Sochi is located in Krasnodar region. I moved to the USA when I was 19 years old. I spent 12 years working in the automotive sales, where got from a salepoerson to a director of sales. While working at the dealership, I studied Finance at George Mason University. I graduated in 2017 with bachelors of finance.</p>
  <br />
  <p>After I left an automotive business, I decided to go into IT industry. But, due to lack of proper education in the field, I decided to take this Full stack Boot Camp. It is a very challenging course, but I like challenges.</p>
